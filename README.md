    To allow users to interact with the website and handle their own reviews, an account system is implemented.<br />
    This accoutn system allows users to create an account, login to that account and post reviews.<br />
    This also allows for reviews to corrospond to users by giving them an author.<br />
    The account system was implemented through PHP and the use of a database.<br />
  **Visually Impaired Accessibility Toggle**<br />
    In order to create a website that was accessible to those with visual disorders a toggle system was implemented.<br />
    This toggle, when clicked, applies a colour invert-filter across the site and alters the layout to reduce eye-stress.<br />
    This is done through create more compact and spaced-out reviews and centering the navigation.<br />
**Sound**<br />
  Each round is accompanied with a background soundtrack, a victory sound-affect upon victory and defeat sound-affect upon defeat. <br />
**Timer**<br />
  Each round has a timer to indicate how long the round has been active, the timer stops updating at victory or defeat.<br />

  Detonating the bomb will lead to a defeat and unflips all tiles.<br />
**Victory**<br />
  Flipping all non-bomb tiles will lead to a victory
