## About

## Functionality
  **Account system**<br />
    Using the right mouse click the user can flag a board tile as a potential bomb,<br />
    this will be indicated with a flagged symbol and render the tile unflippable until it is unflagged.<br />
    The amount of available flags is shown above the board, the amount of total flags is equal to that of the amount of mines for the current mode.<br />
  **Visually Impaired Accessibility Toggle**<br />
    Left clicking an unflagged and unflipped tile will flip it. <br />
    If the tile is valueless, that is a tile with no surrounding bombs, the flipping will cascade and flip surrouding tiles until a numbered tile is flipped.<br />
**Sound**<br />
  Each round is accompanied with a background soundtrack, a victory sound-affect upon victory and defeat sound-affect upon defeat. <br />
**Timer**<br />
  Each round has a timer to indicate how long the round has been active, the timer stops updating at victory or defeat.<br />
**Defeat**<br />
  Detonating the bomb will lead to a defeat and unflips all tiles.<br />
**Victory**<br />
  Flipping all non-bomb tiles will lead to a victory
